= Handling failures with Fault Tolerance

Learn how to use the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification to enable applications to function 
even when one of the microservices is unavailable.

// =================================================================================================
// What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn
You will learn how to build fault tolerant microservices so that you can reduce the impact from failure and 
ensure continued operation of services.
You will use the `@Retry` and `@Fallback` methods to define a criteria on when to retry and to provide an 
alternative solution for a failed execution.
Fault Tolerance enables the applications to function even when one of the services is unavailable, 
making service invocation more resilient.

After starting the application, you will be able to access two microservices to test availability:

* `http://localhost:9080/system/properties` retrieves the information for a specific host

* `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` retrieves the information for a list of all previously registered 
hosts

To learn more about these two microservices and how you can write the MicroProfile application, see
https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-intro.html[Creating a MicroProfile application].

// =================================================================================================
== Why use MP Fault Tolerance?
It is becoming increasingly important to build fault tolerant microservices and MicroProfile (MP) 
Fault Tolerance provides a simple and flexible solution.
Fault tolerance is about leveraging different strategies to guide the execution and result of some logic.
Retry policies, bulkheads, and circuit breakers are popular concepts in this area. 
They dictate whether and when executions should take place, and fallbacks offer an alternative result 
when an execution does not complete successfully.

MP Fault Tolerance offers the following Fault Tolerance policies:

* Timeout: Define a duration for timeout

* Retry: Define a criteria on when to retry

* Fallback: provide an alternative solution for a failed execution

* CircuitBreaker: offer a way of fail fast by automatically failing execution to prevent the system 
overloading and indefinite wait or timeout by the clients

* Bulkhead: isolate failures in part of the system while the rest part of the system can still function

In this guide we will be focusing on `@Retry` and `@Fallback`.

== Enabling Fault Tolerance into the application

Begin by navigating to the `pom.xml` file to check the required dependency. The microprofile-fault-tolerance-api 
dependency has been added for you in the start/pom.xml file. This feature allows you to use the MicroProfile 
Fault Tolerance API to build fault tolerant microservices.

The mpFaultTolerance-1.0 feature has also been enabled in the `start/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file.

Now that the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance feature has been enabled, the application's fallback mechanism needs 
to be set up.

For ease of use, the two microservice being run in this application are being "served up" 
by the same server.
This means that one cannot be taken down without the other.
To overcome this challenge, we will imitate the HTTP responses and Exceptions that would normally be 
executed when a server cannot be reached due to the server being taken down maintenance. Taking the server
up and down dynamically will be done in this guide using dynamic configuration using MP config. If you want 
to learn more about setting up dynamic configuration, see `Configuring Microprofile with MP Config`.

Create the Properties Resource class in `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/PropertiesResource.java`:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/PropertiesResource.java[tags=503_response]
----
This file retrieves all of the system properties and returns them as a JSON Object.
The `getProperties()` method in this class has been modified for this fault tolerance guide so that 
if the config property `io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance` from the 
`CustomConfigProperties.json` file is assigned the value of false, a json object containing the system 
properties is returned. However, if this config property is assigned a value of true, then a 503 HTTP 
response is returned to the browser and a message is returned to the terminal to let the developer 
know that the service is down.

This 503 HTTP response needs to be recognised and acted upon by the other microservice of our application 
(Inventory). To do this, navigate to `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java`
to create the System Client class:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryUtil.java[tags=throw_IOException]
----
This class is a Client for the system service.

In this class there is a method called `setStaus()`. This method returns a boolean based on whether a 200 
response is returned by the system service. If a 200 is returned, the method returns true. However if the response 
is anything other than 200, then false is returned. In this guide, a new if statement has been added to the 
method that checks to see if the response is specifically a 503 response. A 503 HTTP response is returned if the 
server being called is unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance, which 
would likely be alleviated after some delay). If the response is 503, an IOException is thrown. This type of 
exception is thrown when an input or output operation is failed or interpreted.

This `setStatus()` method is called by the public `isResponseOk()` method which is used in 
`InventoryManager.java`.

// =================================================================================================
// Adding the @Retry and @Fallback annotations
// =================================================================================================
== Adding the @Retry and @Fallback annotations

Now that our inventory microservice is able to recognise that the system microservice has been taken 
down for maintenance through the 503 HTTP response retruned as a result and has thrown an IOException 
as a result of this microservice being in maintanence, a fallback method needs to be set out.
Navigate to `start/src/main/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java` to create the 
Inventory Manager class:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java[tags=add_retry_fallback]
----

The `@Retry` annotation specified here dictates on what conditions to retry establishing the connection 
to the system service (i.e. on an IOException) and how many times it should be retried (i.e. 3 times).
The `@Fallback` annotation specified dictates which method to call when the reties are unsuccessful 
(in this case use the fallbackForGet method).

The `fallbackForGet()` method that has been added as the designated fallback method for the original `get()` 
method, checks to see if the properties variable is null. If the properties variable is null, this suggests 
that the application has not been able to successfully reach the system service to get the system's 
properties previously, thus the method simply prints out a json warning message in the browser. However, if 
the properties variable is not null, this method retruns a json of the cached property values to the browser.


Next navigate to `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java` to create the 
Inventory Resource class:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[tags=fault_tolerance]
----

The if statement in this class now returns an error message when the inventory service is down for maintanence 
and calls the `get()` method in the InventoryManager.java class when the inventory service is up and running 
as normal.
All references to the email configuration property have been removed from this file.

The application has now been sucessfully set up to be fault tolerant.

// =================================================================================================

== Starting the application

To see the new application in action, run the Maven `liberty:start-server` command from the `start` 
directory:

[source]
----
$ mvn liberty:start-server
----

Once the server is running, you can test the fault tolerance of the application by dynamically changing 
the `io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance` value in the `CustomConfiProperties.json` file. This 
property will be set to true at first, but change it to false and save the file and your changes will be 
added dynamically, there is no need to reset the server (this is dynamic config). If you want more information 
on how these dynamic configuration properties were set up please visit the "Configuring Microservices" guide 
on the OpenLiberty website. Simply refresh the page now to see the dynamic changes.

Change the value back to true to see the cached version of the properties.

== Testing the application

While you can test your application manually, you should rely on automated tests since they will trigger a 
failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. Since the application is a RESTful web service application, 
you can use JUnit and the RESTful web service Client API to write tests. In testing the functionality of the 
application, the scopes and dependencies are being tested.

Create a start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/faulttolerance/FaultToleranceTest.java file and add 
the following code:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
link:finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/faulttolerance/FaultToleranceTest.java[]
----

The `@BeforeClass` annotation is placed on a method that executes before any of the test cases. In this case, 
the oneTimeSetup method retrieves the port number for the Open Liberty server and builds a base URL string 
that is used throughout the tests.

The `@Before` and `@After` annotations are placed on methods that execute before and after every test case. These 
methods are generally used to perform any setup and teardown tasks. In this case, the setup method creates a 
JAX-RS client which makes HTTP requests to the inventory service. This client must also be registered with a 
JSON-P provider (JsrJsonpProvider) to process JSON resources. The teardown method simply destroys this client 
instance.

Let’s break down the test cases:

* `testFallbackForGet()` returns the system properties for a hostname when inventory service is available. After 
that, it take the System service down and gets the system properties from inventory service when this service 
is down. It then confirms that the system properties for the specific host was returned from the inventory 
service when the system service is down by asserting if the total number of the system properties, when 
the system service is up, is greater than the total number of the system properties when service is down. The 
total number of system properties from inventory service and system service should differ because the inventory 
service only caches two of the system properties returned from the system service.


* `testRetryGettingSystemProperties()` checks to see if the retry is being called the same number 
of times as stated by the max retries in the `@Retry` annotation. If the count from the retry method is equal to 
the expected number of times for the retry being called, then the service returns a valid response. Otherwise, 
the service returns the following message: ERROR: Server is currently in maintenance. 


To force these test cases to execute in a particular order, put them in a testSuite() method and label it with 
a `@Test` annotation so that it automatically executes when your test class run.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/guides-common/master/mvnverify.adoc

To see whether the tests detect a failure, remove the reset retries method of 
the `FaultToleranceTest.java` file. Re-run the Maven build. You will see a test failure occur for the 
testRetryGettingSystemProperties() test case.


The program might take some time to execute the tests. If the tests pass, you receive the following output:
