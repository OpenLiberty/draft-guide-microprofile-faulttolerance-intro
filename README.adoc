= Handling failures with Fault Tolerance

Learn how to add retry and fallback behavior to microservice dependencies to manage the impact of failures.

// =================================================================================================
// What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build fault tolerant microservices so that you can reduce the impact from failure and
ensure continued operation of services.

The application that you will be working with is an `inventory` service, which stores the information about
various JVMs that run on different systems. Whenever a request is made to the `inventory` service to retrieve
the JVM system properties of a particular host, the `inventory` service communicates with the `system` service on 
that host to get these system properties. The system properties are then stored and returned.


You will use the `@Retry` and `@Fallback` Fault Tolerance annotations to define a criteria on when to retry and when to
provide an alternative solution for a failed execution.
Fault Tolerance enables the application to function even when one of it's services is unavailable,
making service invocation more resilient.

The implementation of the application and its services are provided for you in the `start/src` directory.
The `system` service can be found in `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system`, and the `inventory`
service can be found in `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory`. If you want to learn how to
create a RESTful application, see https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service].

=== Why use MP Fault Tolerance?

It is becoming increasingly important to build fault tolerant microservices and MicroProfile (MP)
Fault Tolerance provides a simple and flexible solution.
Fault tolerance is about leveraging different strategies to guide the execution and result of some logic.
Retry policies, bulkheads, and circuit breakers are popular concepts in this area.
They dictate whether and when executions should take place, and fallbacks offer an alternative result
when an execution does not complete successfully.

MP Fault Tolerance offers the following Fault Tolerance policies:

* Timeout: Define a duration for timeout

* Retry: Define a criteria on when to retry

* Fallback: provide an alternative solution for a failed execution

* CircuitBreaker: offer a way of fail fast by automatically failing execution to prevent the system
overloading and indefinite wait or timeout by the clients

* Bulkhead: isolate failures in part of the system while the rest part of the system can still function

In this guide we will be focusing on `@Retry` and `@Fallback`.

// Getting Started
// =================================================================================================

== Getting started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the Git repository and use the starting project that is provided in the `start` directory. To do this, run the following commands:

[subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/draft-guide-{projectid}.git
cd draft-guide-{projectid}/start
----


// =================================================================================================
// Try what you'll build
// =================================================================================================

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished fault tolerance implementation
for the application. Feel free to give it a try before you proceed with building your own.

To try out the application, first navigate to the `finish` directory and then execute the following
Maven goals to build the application and run it inside Open Liberty:

```
mvn clean install liberty:start-server

```

Point your browser to the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost` URL. You see a result in
JSON format with the system properties of your local JVM. When you visit this URL, these system properties
are automatically stored in the inventory.

Now navigate to the `CustomConfigSource.json` file in the `finish/resource` directory and change the property
`io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance` from `false` to `true` and save the file. There is no need to
restart the server. Now return to your browser and point back to the
`http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost` URL. You will now see the cached properties from
systems for this localhost due to the `system` service now being in maintenance.
For simplicity, only the OS name and username are stored in cache for each host.

Once you are done checking out the application, go to the `CustomConfigSource.json` file again and change the
property `io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance` from `true` to `false` to set this condition back to its original value.

Stop the Open Liberty server:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Now, navigate back to the `start` directory to begin.

// =================================================================================================
// Enabling Fault Tolerance in the application
// =================================================================================================

== Enabling Fault Tolerance in the application

The MicroProfile Fault Tolerance API has been added as a dependency to your `pom.xml` file. Look for the
dependancy with the groupID `org.eclipse.microprofile.fault-tolerance`.
This feature allows you to use the MicroProfile
Fault Tolerance API to build fault tolerant microservices.
The `mpFaultTolerance-1.0` feature has also been enabled in the `start/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file.


For ease of use, the two microservices being run in this application are being "served up"
by the same server.
This means that one cannot be taken down without the other.
To overcome this challenge, we will imitate the HTTP responses and Exceptions that would normally be
executed when a server cannot be reached due to the server being taken down for maintenance. Taking the server
up and down dynamically using dynamic configuration with MP config. If you want
to learn more about setting up dynamic configuration,
see https://github.com/OpenLiberty/draft-guide-microprofile-config[Configuring microservices].

Create the `system` resource class in the `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemResource.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemResource.java[tags=503_response]
----
This file retrieves all of the system properties and returns them as a JSON Object.
The `getProperties()` method in this class has been modified for this fault tolerance guide so that
if the config property `io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance` from the
`CustomConfigSource.json` file is assigned the value of false, a json object containing the system
properties is returned. However, if this config property is assigned a value of true, then a 503 HTTP
response is returned to the browser and a message is returned to the terminal to let the developer
know that the service is down.

This 503 HTTP response needs to be recognised and acted upon by the `inventory` microservice.
To do this, create the `system` client class in the
`start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java[tags=throw_IOException;!copyright;!javadoc]
----
This class is a Client for the `system` service.

In this class there is a method called `getPropertiesHelper()`. This method returns a response based on whether a 200
HTTP response is returned by the `system` service. If a 200 is returned, the method returns the system properties
returned from the `system` service. However if the response is anything other than 200, then a message is printed in
the terminal to explain that the response status was not Ok. In this guide, a new if statement has been added to the
method that checks to see if the response is specifically a 503 response. A 503 HTTP response is returned if the
server being called is unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance, which
would likely be alleviated after some delay. If the response is 503, an IOException is thrown. This type of
exception is thrown when an input or output operation is failed or interpreted.

This `getPropertiesHelper()` method is called by the public `getProperties()` method which is used in
`InventoryManager.java`.

// =================================================================================================
// Adding the @Retry and @Fallback annotations
// =================================================================================================
=== Adding the @Retry and @Fallback annotations

Our `inventory` microservice is now able to recognise that the `system` microservice has been taken
down for maintenance through the 503 HTTP response retruned. As a result, it has thrown an IOException.
A fallback method now needs to be set out to deal with this failure.
Create the inventory manager class in the `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java[tags=add_retry_fallback]
----

The `@Retry` annotation specified here dictates on what conditions to retry establishing the connection
to the `system` service and how many times it should be retried, in this case three times.
The `@Fallback` annotation specified dictates which method to call when the reties are unsuccessful
(in this case use the fallbackForGet method).

The `fallbackForGet()` method that has been added as the designated fallback method for the original `get()`
method, checks to see if the properties variable is null. If the properties variable is null, this suggests
that the application has not been able to successfully reach the `system` service to get the system's
properties previously, thus the method simply prints out a json warning message in the browser. However, if
the properties variable is not null, this method returns a json of the cached property values to the browser.


Next create the `inventory` resource class in `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java` file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[tags=fault_tolerance]
----

The if statement in this class now returns an error message when the `inventory` service is down for maintenance
and calls the `get()` method in the InventoryManager.java class when the `inventory` service is up and running
as normal.
All references to the email configuration property have been removed from this file.

The application has now been successfully set up to be fault tolerant.

// =================================================================================================
// Building and running the application
// =================================================================================================

== Building and running the application

To build the application, run the Maven install goal from the command line:

```
  mvn install
```

This goal builds the application and creates a .war file in the target directory and also
configures and installs Open Liberty into the target/liberty/wlp directory.

Next, run the Maven liberty:start-server goal:

```
  mvn liberty:start-server
```

This goal starts an Open Liberty server instance. Your Maven pom.xml is already configured to
start the application in this server instance.

Once the server is running, point your browser to the `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost` URL.
You see a result in JSON format with the system properties of your local JVM.
You can test the fault tolerance mechanism of your application by dynamically changing
the `io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance` property value to `true` in the `start/resource/CustomConfigSource.json` file.
After saving the file, go back to your browser and click refresh to see the cached version of the properties.
The cached system properties only have the OS name and username key and value pairs.

If you make changes to the code, use the Maven package command to rebuild the application and have
the running Open Liberty server pick them up automatically:

```
  mvn package
```

To stop the Open Liberty server, run the Maven liberty:stop-server goal:

```
  mvn liberty:stop-server
```

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the application
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the application

While you can test your application manually, you should rely on automated tests since they will trigger a
failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. Since the application is a RESTful web service application,
you can use JUnit and the RESTful web service Client API to write tests. In testing the functionality of the
application, the scopes and dependencies are being tested.

Create the `FaultToleranceTest` class in the `start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/faulttolerance/` file:

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/faulttolerance/FaultToleranceTest.java[tags=ft_testing;!javadoc]
----

The `@BeforeClass` annotation is placed on a method that executes before any of the test cases. In this case,
the `oneTimeSetup()` method retrieves the port number for the Open Liberty server and builds a base URL string
that is used throughout the tests.

The `@Before` and `@After` annotations are placed on methods that execute before and after every test case. These
methods are generally used to perform any setup and teardown tasks. In this case, the setup method creates a
JAX-RS client which makes HTTP requests to the `inventory` service. This client must also be registered with a
JSON-P provider (JsrJsonpProvider) to process JSON resources. The teardown method simply destroys this client
instance as well as the HTTP responses, resets the changed configuration file and the retry counter.

Let’s break down the test cases:

* `testFallbackForGet()` sends a request to `inventory` service to get the systems properties for a
hostname, when `system` service is avialable. Then, it puts the `system` service on maintenance. After that,
it makes a second request to `inventory` service to return the system properties for that hostname.
Lastly, it asserts if the system properties returned from the first request were more than the second time.

** In the second request, the fallback method from `inventory` service was called to return the cached properties. However for the first request, the `inventory` service returned the properties from making a connection to `system` service.

* `testRetryGettingSystemProperties()` sends a request to `inventory` service to try to get the system properties even though
`system` service is still in maintenanace from previous test case. Then, it reads the retry counter in `/inventory/retries` endpoint to assert it with the number of retries happened to get the system properties from `inventory` service.

** The `inventory` service should retry the same number of times as stated by the `maxRetries` attribute in the `@Retry` annotation to get the system properties. However, it makes a first call on the annotated method assuming that `system` service is avialable. As a result, the total calls on this method are four.

To force these test cases to execute in a particular order, put them in a testSuite() method and label it with
a `@Test` annotation so that it automatically executes when your test class run.

//include::{common-includes}/mvnverify.adoc[]
=== Running the tests

If the server is still running from the previous steps, stop it first using the Maven `liberty:stop-server` goal:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Then, verify that the tests pass using the Maven `verify` goal:

```
mvn verify
```

It may take some time before build is complete. If the tests pass, you will see a similar output to the following:

```
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.faulttolerance.FaultToleranceTest
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.322 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.faulttolerance.FaultToleranceTest
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.inventory.EndpointTest
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.307 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.inventory.EndpointTest

Results :

Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

To see whether the tests detect a failure, remove the reset retries method of
the `FaultToleranceTest.java` file. Re-run the Maven build. You will see a test failure occur for the
`testRetryGettingSystemProperties()` test case.
